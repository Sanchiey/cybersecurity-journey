o	OSI and TCP/IP models
o	Ports, protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, ICMP, DNS, DHCP, etc.)
o	IP Addressing & Subnetting
o	IPv4 addressing and subnet masks
o	VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)
o	Designing IP address schemes
o	Switching
o	Ethernet frames and MAC addresses
o	VLANs (Virtual LANs), access vs trunk ports
o	Routing
o	Static routes and default routes
o	Intro to OSPF and BGP concepts
o	IP Services
o	DHCP configuration and relay
o	DNS basics
o	NAT and port forwarding
o	Troubleshooting
o	Tools: ping, traceroute, netstat, ss, ip route
o	Diagnosing connectivity issues
🛠️ Tools Used
-	Cisco Packet Tracer  
-	VirtualBox + Linux VMs  
-	Wireshark  
-	ipcalc / subnet calculators 
📖 Reflection
Networking Basics was a turning point in my cybersecurity journey.  
o	Subnetting trained me in logical thinking and binary math.  
o	VLANs and routing showed me how real-world networks separate and forward traffic.  
o	Wireshark gave me visibility into how data flows across a network.  
•	I can now confidently read packet captures, configure small networks, and troubleshoot connectivity issues.  
•	This foundation prepares me for Networking Devices & Initial Configuration and, ultimately, my cybersecurity specialization.
